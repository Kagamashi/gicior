git pull is used to fetch changes from a remote repository and automatically merge them into your current branch.
It combines git fetch (downloads changes) and git merge (applies changes) in one command.

# pull changes from default remote (origin) and current branch
git pull

# pull changes from specific branch
git pull origin [branch_name]
